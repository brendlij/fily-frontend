## API Endpoints

The frontend communicates with the following backend endpoints:

| Action        | HTTP Method | Route                 | Parameters                       | Description                       |
| ------------- | ----------- | --------------------- | -------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| List files    | GET         | `/api/files`          | `?path=folder/subfolder`         | List files and folders            |
| Upload        | POST        | `/api/files/upload`   | `file` (FormData), `path` (opt.) | Upload file to folder             |
| Download      | GET         | `/api/files/download` | `?path=filename`                 | Download file or folder           |
| Create folder | POST        | `/api/files/mkdir`    | `path=foldername`                | Create new folder                 |
| Delete        | DELETE      | `/api/files`          | `?path=folder/or/file`           | Delete file or folder (recursive) |
| Rename        | POST        | `/api/files/rename`   | `oldPath=...`, `newName=...`     | Rename file or folder             |

## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js v18 or later
- Java backend running on `localhost:8080`

### Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone [your-repo-url]
cd fily-frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

The app will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Configuration

### Next.js Rewrites

API requests are proxied to the Java backend using Next.js rewrites:

```typescript
// next.config.ts
{
  source: '/api/:path*',
  destination: 'http://localhost:8080/api/:path*'
}
```

Update this if your backend runs on a different port.

### Theme Configuration

- 8 color schemes: blue (default), green, red, purple, orange, teal, pink, cyan
- Themes and color preferences are saved in `localStorage`
- Dark/Light mode toggle with instant update

```typescript
// Settings are stored in localStorage
localStorage.setItem("fily-color-scheme", "dark");
localStorage.setItem("fily-custom-color", "purple");
```

## Main Components

- **LoginScreen:** Simple authentication with demo credentials (`admin`/`admin`), error handling, animated background
- **FileBrowser:** Header navigation, settings, logout, file grid with transitions, modals for upload, create folder, and rename
- **Settings:** Theme switcher and color picker, persistent preferences
- **File Operations:** Upload (drag & drop), download, rename, delete, context menu
- **Responsive UI:** Works on desktop, tablet, and mobile with adaptive layout

## Security

- All API calls routed through Next.js rewrites (no CORS issues)
- File path validation on the backend
- Secure file operations and error handling

## Production Build

```bash
npm run build
npm start
```
